                Panchakosha is a yoga idea about the five coverings of people. It looks at different parts or levels of
                human beings in philosophy. These coverings are believed to include different parts of a person, making
                an overall view about life.

        <h2>Pancha Kosha Yoga</h2>
        <p>
            The Panchakosha model comes from old yogic writings like the Taittiriya
            Upanishad and the Taittiriya Aranyaka. These ancient texts are where this idea started. Let’s explore
            each of the Panchakoshas:

                <h3>Annamaya Kosha</h3>
                <p>
                    The physical body or the food sheath.<br>
                    It represents the physical aspect of the human being.</p>
                <p>
                    This outside part is about the body you can see, such as bones, muscles and organs. It also includes
                    things that make up your whole human shape.
                    Practices linked to Annamaya Kosha involve doing yoga poses (asanas) and eating mindfully to keep
                    our body healthy.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h3>Pranamaya Kosha</h3>
                <p>
                    The energy or life-force sheath.<br> 
                    It governs the flow of vital energy in the body through breath and prana.</p>
                <p>
                    Pranamaya Kosha is about the vital life energy that makes our body come alive. It includes air, blood
                    flow and energy all over the body.
                    Breath control exercises called pranayama are very important for keeping the Pranamaya Kosha in
                    balance.

                <h3>Manomaya Kosha</h3>
                <p>
                    The mental or emotional sheath.<br>
                    It involves thoughts, emotions, and mental processes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Manomaya Kosha is linked with the mind and feelings of a person. It includes feelings, emotions and
                    how the mind works.
                    Activities such as meditating, being mindful and saying good things try to help the mental health of
                    Manomaya Kosha.

                <p>
                    The wisdom sheath.
                    It represents the intellect and the higher discriminative mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This sheath shows smart thinking, good judgment and making smart decisions. Vijnanamaya Kosha is
                    linked to intuition, seeing more deeply and understanding oneself better.
                    Practices that help us understand ourselves, ask questions about life and learn new things build up our
                    Vijnanamaya Kosha.

                    The bliss sheath.<br>
                     It is the innermost layer, associated with deep peace and joy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The deepest part is Anandamaya Kosha, connected to the
                    happiness and joy that goes beyond pleasure and pain. It symbolizes a deep calm and happiness.
                    Praying, being loyal and touching one’s inner feeling help in Anandamaya Kosha enjoyment.
